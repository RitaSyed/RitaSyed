    <h2>Week 1 of NSS</h2>
    <p>I think the most interesting topic this week was GIT and github. GIT is challenging to learn at first because of it unique concept. However, once I practiced using GIT, I understood how it makes "life" easier for developers. I wish that before I started NSS, I had used GIT and github for practice on my own. On the other hand, GIT commands should be used carefully, especially git rm command!</p>
    <h2>Week 3 of NSS</h2>
    <p>Week 3 of NSS started with “introduction” of JavaScript. I put it in quotes because I felt that this introduction to JavaScript accelerated to more advance topics such as looping through arrays on the second day of class after we started JavaScript. Moreover, there was a homework of array challenges! This is where I wrote and solved my very FIRST JavaScript challenges! Every time I solved a challenge, I felt rush of energy! I think I am addicted to coding...</p>
    <h2>Week 4 of NSS</h2>
    <p>Week 4 of NSS. I learned Objects and Functions. And of course, more homework challenges on Objects and Functions!!! I think it’s getting easier to solve challenges and it’s less time consuming. I spend a lot of time reading MDN and researching to complete challenges using different approaches.</p>

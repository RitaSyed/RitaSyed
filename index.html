    I think the most interesting topic this week was GIT and github. GIT is challenging to learn at first because of it unique concept. However, once I practiced using GIT, I understood how it makes "life" easier for developers. I wish that before I started NSS, I had used GIT and github for practice on my own. On the other hand, GIT commands should be used carefully, especially git rm command!

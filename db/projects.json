      "post": "I think the most interesting topic this week was GIT and github. GIT is challenging to learn at first because of it unique concept. However, once I practiced using GIT, I understood how it makes 'life' easier for developers. I wish that before I started NSS, I had used GIT and github for practice on my own. On the other hand, GIT commands should be used carefully, especially git rm command!"

      "post": "Week 3 of NSS started with “introduction” of JavaScript. I put it in quotes because I felt that this introduction to JavaScript accelerated to more advance topics such as looping through arrays on the second day of class after we started JavaScript. Moreover, there was a homework of array challenges! This is where I wrote and solved my very FIRST JavaScript challenges! Every time I solved a challenge, I felt rush of energy! I think I am addicted to coding..."

I think it’s getting easier to solve challenges and it’s less time consuming. I spend a lot of time reading MDN and researching to complete challenges using different approaches."

      "post": "Weeks 5 and 6 of NSS. I completed a limited Language Translator, Music Band website, and Travel Diary projects. The Translator project translates from English to 3 other predefined languages with limited vocabulary. While completing this project, I learned to break down project into small and simple steps. This approach helped me complete this and the following projects, and helped me write tickets more efficiently. Music Band Website was a team project where each member wrote tickets and completed it. I, as a team member, was working on a specific part of the project according to the picked ticket and then pushed it to GitHub. I resolved my GitHub conflicts, reviewed and approved pull requests of other team members. Communication was the key to successful completion of the project before deadline.The Travel Diary project was one of my favorite projects. I completed all the bonus assignments, including delete and edit a diary entry. I would rather go and do more coding then write about it... LOL I enjoy working on projects with a team but I am also comfortable to work on projects alone, and research and solve code issues."

      "post": "I learned Bootstrap and completed Treehouse Cage Match project using Bootstrap.  I spent lots of time on figuring out Bootstrap while doing Treehouse Cage Match project  than on the JavaScript code. It is in my plants to go back and make my code better. Bootstrap is time consuming to learn but I think that once I practice more Bootstrap, I will get faster implementing it in my projects."

      "post": "This week I learned task runners and browserify. I applied learned material to complete project - Adoption Website.There is different file structure setup and it was confusing at first but it helped me organize my code better instead of having just one js file with hundreds line of code in it. Also I like to access parsed data as needed and still keep it secure. However, circular dependencies can be a problem therefore I had to keep it in mind while working on the Adoption Website project."

However,  I decided to break down the project to even smaller and simpler steps and started to code things I know how to do first. This decision helped me overcome the 'I don't know where to start' thinking and complete the project."

Even though each person had similar skill level, I learned a lot from each person by looking at their code. The hardest part for our group was planning and writing tickets but once that was done, coding was easy and fast. I am looking forward to work with this team again on the next project."

I was able to complete the homework assignment - exTracker part 2 where I used promises. Also, NSS instructor, Lauren, gave me one-on-one time to answer conceptual questions about promises and look over my homework code."
